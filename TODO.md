## 1. Support size-fitting (fit to parent, contents, window, specific shapes, box-model? )
## 2. Support Anchoring to bottom, right, left, center, etc. maybe define position.x = -1 to be the right-anchor?
## 3. Separate the render loop (including animation updates; requestAnimationFrame) from the logic loop (setTimeout, or Shape.in())
## 4. Pivot position (for rotations and translations)
